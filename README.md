# Emergency_backup_RUST
This project is a Rust-based application for performing backups when the screen is unresponsive. Users initiate and confirm backups using mouse gestures (e.g., drawing a rectangle and minus sign). It supports configurable backup sources, logs CPU usage every 2 minutes, and generates a final log with backup details.
